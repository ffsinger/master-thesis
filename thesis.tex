The boom of artificial intelligence and machine learning seen in the past decade has had significant impact on societies, with the rise of recommender systems, image recognition software and large-scale advertisement platforms, to name a few. These advances can be beneficial, but they come with many risks and challenges that are often disregarded for the sake of short-term profit.

One of the main challenge is related to the sensitivity of the data used in these systems. As many different actors are usually participating in the training and usage of a machine learning model, the data providers need to place a high level of trust in the other actors.

This trust can be achieved through legal bindings, but only technological safeguards can provide real guarantees that the data will not be misused.

One of these safeguards is to hide the data with encryption. However, the mainstream cryptography of today only protects the data while in transit or at rest, and it cannot be used when performing operations on it. This limitation is fortunately lifted in a particular subset of cryptographic schemes, called homomorphic encryption schemes. These have the advantage of allowing some operations, primarily additions and multiplications, while keeping the numbers fully encrypted.

The downside of this approach is that it comes with severe performance and precision limitations, and is thus difficult to apply in the context of machine learning where computations are already gluttonous in resources. Nevertheless, this has been an active research field that has seen promising advances in the past decade [...].

The goal of this thesis is to identify, implement and evaluate the state-of-the-art solutions of homomorphically encrypted machine learning. It also aims to formalize and describe on a more granular level which steps of a machine learning algorithm can be protected using homomorphic encryption, and why.

\section{Logistic regression}

Logistic regression is a simple and widely used model for classification. Given a set of $n$ training points $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and the corresponding label $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$, the training phase consists of learning a vector of weights $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ minimizing the loss function:
\begin{equation}\label{logistic_reg_train}
    \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(1 + \exp(-\mathbf{z}_i^T \mathbf{w})) 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{z}_i = y_i \cdot (1, \mathbf{x}_i)$ for $i=1,...,n$.

A common method used to minimize the loss function is the gradient descent algorithm. It iteratively updates the weights vector by following the direction opposite to the gradient of the function:
\begin{align}\label{gradient_descent}
    \mathbf{w}^{t+1} & = \mathbf{w}^t - \gamma\nabla\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) \nonumber \\ 
    & = \mathbf{w}^t + \frac{\gamma}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma(-\mathbf{z}_i^T \mathbf{w}^t) \cdot \mathbf{z}_i
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is the learning rate and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function (or logistic function) defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{sigmoid}
    \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}

Classifying a new point $\mathbf{x}$ can be done as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{logistic_reg_pred}
    y = 
    \begin{cases}
        1, & \text{if } (1, \mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{w} > 0 \\
        -1, & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Neural networks}

Neural networks are defined as a succession of \emph{layers}, each consisting of operations on a set of input neurons, which are typically real numbers.

Basic networks make use of \emph{fully connected} (or linear) layers, which are defined as such for an input vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, a weights matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$ and a bias vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^k$:

\begin{equation}\label{linear_layer}
    h^{\mathrm{linear}}(\mathbf{x}) = W \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
\end{equation}

Usually, a non-linear \emph{activation function} is applied to the output in order to learn more complex decision boundaries. The most common is $\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$, but the sigmoid (\ref{sigmoid}) or the hyperbolic tangent function are also often used.

The training phase is made of two main steps. First, a data point (or a batch of data points) is evaluated successively through the layers, in what we call the forward pass. Then, we perform a gradient descent by computing the gradients at each neuron and by updating the weights, starting from the end of the network. This is called the backward pass.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new data points. For this operation, only the forward pass is required.

\subsection{Convolutional neural networks}

In many practical cases, particularly for image recognition, the input dimensions can be quite big. This is a problem, because a linear layer connects every input neuron with every output neuron. In order to improve performance and better exploit the spatiality properties of pixels in images, we can limit the connections of a pixel to its neighborhood. This amounts to applying a convolution.

For an image $x \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times h \times w}$ with $c$ channels, a height of $h$ and a width of $w$ pixels, a 2D convolutional layer is defined as follows for each output channel $i$:
\begin{equation}\label{conv2d_layer}
    h_i^{\mathrm{conv2d}}(x) = b_i + \sum_{k=1}^{c} w_{i, k} \star x_{k}
\end{equation}
where $b_i$ is the bias, $w_i \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times k_1 \times k_2}$ is the kernel and $\star$ is the 2D cross-correlation operation.

Another important type of layer is the \emph{pooling} layer, that will aggregate a neighborhood of neurons into one value. The type of aggregate is usually a \emph{max} operation or an \emph{average}.

The traditional architecture of a convolutional neural network starts with an alternate of convolutions, activation functions and pooling layers. Then, the input is flatten into one dimension and feeded to a sequence of fully connected layers.

\section{Homomorphic encryption}

The basic idea of homomorphic encryption is to allow computations on encrypted data, which is not possible with most modern schemes used today. This problem has been studied for many years, with the first schemes supporting only one type of operation, such as the Paillier \cite{stern_public-key_1999} cryptosystem supporting homomorphic additions. 

The main revolution of the field was due to Gentry \cite{gentry_fully_2009} in 2009, when he presented a blueprint for constructing fully homomorphic encryption schemes. Fully homomorphic schemes support two types of primitive operations, typically additions and multiplications, and can evaluate arithmetic circuits of arbitrary depth thanks to a \emph{bootstrapping} procedure.

From this blueprint were born many cryptosystems that are used today, such as BGV \cite{brakerski_leveled_2012}, BFV \cite{fan_somewhat_2012}, or CKKS \cite{cheon_homomorphic_2016, cheon_full_2018}. The former two work with vectors of integers, and the latter works with vectors of complex numbers.

Here is a list of the basic operations available with CKKS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{KeyGen}: Generate a public key and a private key.
    \item \texttt{Encode}: Encode a vector of complex numbers into a plaintext, which is a polynomial in the ring $R = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$.
    \item \texttt{Decode}: Decode a plaintext back into a vector.
    \item \texttt{Encrypt}: Encrypt a plaintext with the public key into an element of $R_q^2$ where $R_q = R/qR$ is a set of polynomials with coefficients modulo $q$.
    \item \texttt{Decrypt}: Decrypt a ciphertext with the private key.
    \item \texttt{Add}: Pairwise addition of two ciphertexts, or one ciphertext and one plaintext.
    \item \texttt{Multiply}: Pairwise multiplication of two ciphertexts/plaintext.
    \item \texttt{Rotate}: Permute the elements in a ciphertext by shifting them by $k$ positions.
    \item \texttt{Relinearize}: After a multiplication, the resulting ciphertext will be in $R_q^3$ and will continue to grow after each multiplication. Relinearization is used to bring it back to $R_q^2$ and facilitate decryption.
    \item \texttt{Rescale}: Rounding operation performed to maintain the size of a ciphertext after a multiplication.
    \item \texttt{Bootstrap} \cite{nielsen_bootstrapping_2018}: Refresh a ciphertext once it reached its maximum number of operations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Threat model}

In order to justify the use of cryptography as a mitigation, it is useful to identify and formalize the potential threats that a machine learning system can face. This also helps us to understand how this type of mitigation can be bypassed.

\subsection{Data-flow diagram}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/dataflow-ml.png}
    \caption{Dataflow diagram for a general ML system.}
    \label{fig:dataflow}
\end{figure}

In order to better visualize how a machine learning system looks like, figure \ref{fig:dataflow} attempts to model the data flow in a general case. This diagram could be refined in more concrete applications. For instance, the model provider and the data collector may be the same entity, which would remove a trust boundary. Another gray area is the feature extraction process that can happen in different ways: it could be done directly on the client and the data collector, or it could rely on an external service controlled by the model provider.

Thus, in this case, the goal of this diagram is to be a tool for identifying the threats, rather than an exhaustive reference.

\subsection{Adversaries}

[List here, or remove and mention in following section.]

\subsection{Threats}

From surveys of the ML security literature \cite{liu_survey_2018, rigaki_survey_2021}, we can identify many types of threats:

% TODO maybe as subsections, with more details

\begin{itemize}
    \item Poisoning attacks
    \item Evasion/impersonation attacks
    \item Membership inference attack
    \item Inversion attack
    \item Model extraction attack
    \item Attribute inference attack (leakings features of samples)
    \item Property inference attack (leaking features of datasets)
    \item Data ordering attack
\end{itemize}

[What we will focus on (training phase and inference phase). How it solves the problem.]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Secure training}

Among the threats that we identified, one is that external actors, such as hackers or cloud providers, could observe the training process and exfiltrate the data. A potential defense mechanism is to train the model on homomorphically encrypted data.

As training can be a fairly complex and resource-intensive process, it is wise to start with a simple classification model. Logistic regression models are simple and have been extensively studied as part of the 2017 iDASH secure genome analysis competition. The winning solution has been proposed by Kim et al. ~\cite{kim_logistic_2018}. This will be the basis of our implementation.

[Packing.]

[No bootstrapping, but it would be interesting to compare. The problem is that few libraries implement the bootstrapping operation.]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Private inference}

In the case of an inference service provided by a model owner to a client, another threat is that the client's data can be abused. Even with a privacy policy, the client has no technical guarantee that this data will not be shared, stolen, or used for different purposes. Homomorphic encryption aims to reduce this risk, thus improving the overall trust in the system. 

There are two approaches to this problem. In both cases, we assume that a model has been trained beforehand. 

In the most common approach, the client encrypts the data and sends it to the inference service, who learns nothing about the data and the inference result.

In the second approach, the weights of the model are encrypted and sent to the client. This requires an additional round-trip of communications for the decryption step, which can reveal the inference result to the service if no precautions are made. In addition, the architecture of the model must be revealed to the client, which incurs the risk of it being stolen and retrained from scratch by a competitor. Due to these limitations, we will focus on the first approach, but the runtime estimates should not differ too much between the two.

Because inference requires much less resources than training, we can look at more complex models. As neural networks are extremely popular nowadays, a deep learning framework compatible with encrypted data has many use-cases.
